## About

This software is a culmination of my interest in both finance and programming. It not only displays my proficiency in Python but also showcases an intricate understanding of financial data, movements, and market sentiments.

It fetches real-time stock data for prominent indices like SPY and QQQ, evaluates the movement of their respective components, and visualizes the probability of the index's movement direction based on the performance of its components.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch recent stock data.
- **Probabilistic Analysis:** Determines the probable movement direction of stock indices based on the performance of its components.
- **Visual Representation:** Graphical visualization of the movement probabilities.
- **Detailed Logging:** Every event, prediction, and actual movement is meticulously logged for future reference and accuracy analysis.
- **Error Handling:** Efficiently handles potential data-fetching errors without crashing.
  
## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/Mars0239/TrendRider]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install yfinance matplotlib pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. The software will fetch data every 5 minutes, display the probable movement of the indices, and log the predictions against actual movements.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** The backbone of this application, showcasing the depth of my expertise.
- **Yfinance:** A popular library to fetch real-time stock data.
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting the probabilistic analysis.
- **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation.
